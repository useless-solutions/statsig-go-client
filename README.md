This is a Go client for the Statsig API. It is code-generated from the official OpenAPI spec and intended for use primarily in the [useless-solutions/terraform-provider-statsig](https://github.com/useless-solutions/terraform-provider-statsig) project. The project uses the official [Statsig OpenAPI specification](https://docs.statsig.com/console-api/all-endpoints-generated). The current version is `20240601`.

> The Console API is versioned. Each version is guaranteed to not break existing usage; each new version introduces breaking changes. There is currently only one version: 20240601.
